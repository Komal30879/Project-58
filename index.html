      <p>My favorite hobby is Drawing. I mostly like to draw various sketches of different animals and birds. Now I am also learning to draw various water color paintings. I like to draw picture of animals as I am an animal lover. Drawing makes my mind calm and stress free. By drawing I also feel happy and very joyful. Whenever I get free time I sit don and start drawing a nice picture. I have drawn a lot of pictures and I am going to make a sketch book out of them at which I would in the future. Drawing is the best thing I like to do. </p>
